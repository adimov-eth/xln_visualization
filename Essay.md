# Extended Lightning Network (XLN)

**XLN (Extended Lightning Network)** is a new layer-2 payment network designed to make crypto transactions as fast and easy as traditional digital payments, but without sacrificing decentralization. It builds on the idea of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network – moving transactions off-chain for speed – and extends it to overcome Lightning’s well-known limitations. For example, the Lightning Network required users to pre-fund channels and often struggled with “inbound capacity” (a new user couldn’t easily receive payments until someone opened a channel to them). XLN removes these hurdles by introducing **flexible payment channels with built-in credit lines**. In practice, this means you don’t have to lock up 100% of the funds in advance or micromanage channels to send and receive crypto. A participant (often a **hub** node) can extend a small line of credit within the channel, so payments can flow even if one side has no pre-deposited balance. This credit is secured by cryptographic proofs and optional collateral, ensuring that if a party disappears or misbehaves, the latest balances can still be settled on-chain fairly. By solving Lightning’s inbound liquidity and full-collateralization problems, XLN makes it much easier for a new user to start receiving funds instantly without any upfront setup. At the same time, it greatly improves capital efficiency – participants don’t have to keep large amounts of money idle in channels – while still maintaining security through on-chain dispute mechanisms.

**High-Level Architecture:** XLN operates through a network of **bi-directional payment channels** similar to Lightning, but with several key twists. Users and hubs open channels by depositing funds into a special on-chain contract (the “jurisdiction” contract) that acts as a minimal root of trust. Once a channel is open, nearly all activity happens off-chain: the two parties simply exchange signed messages to update balances, so transfers are instant and feel “fee-free” (no per-transaction cost). The blockchain is only invoked if needed – for example, to open/close channels, or to resolve a dispute if one side stops cooperating. This off-chain focus allows **massive scaling**. There’s no global ledger slowing things down or expensive roll-up of every transaction; each channel carries its own state, and the network can process many millions of transactions per second in aggregate. Hubs in XLN function a bit like payment routers (analogous to banks in the traditional system), coordinating liquidity and routing payments, but **anyone can become a hub** – there is no central operator or privileged node. Importantly, XLN supports **multi-asset channels**: you can use Bitcoin, Ethereum tokens, Solana assets, etc., all within one unified network. It has native support for **cross-chain atomic swaps**, meaning the network can convert and transfer value across different blockchains seamlessly. For instance, a user could send a payment in Bitcoin to a recipient who wants to receive it as USDC on Ethereum – XLN will handle the swap under the hood using hash-time-lock contracts, ensuring that either both sides of the swap execute or none do. This built-in interoperability (as opposed to bolt-on bridges) is a major differentiator. It allows **near-instant settlement** even across chains – there’s no waiting for lengthy withdrawal processes or relying on centralized exchanges for conversion. From a user perspective, XLN abstracts away a lot of complexity: there’s _no need to manually manage channels or worry about chain compatibility_, since the network and its hubs handle routing, currency conversion, and liquidity behind the scenes. You just specify what you want to send and to whom, and the payment goes through in a fraction of a second with finality.

**Why XLN is Unique:** There’s currently no other system that combines all these capabilities with a decentralized trust model. Traditional Lightning-style networks are trustless and secure but have rigid constraints (one asset per network, 100% collateral per channel, tricky user experience). On the other end, some cross-chain payment solutions rely on centralized intermediaries or custodial bridges, which introduce counterparty risk and points of failure. **XLN strikes a novel balance**. It **re-implements a banking-like model within a crypto network**: hubs can extend credit (much like banks do) to facilitate smooth payments, and users gain speed and flexibility in return. Crucially, this doesn’t mean giving up security or decentralization – all channel states are enforceable on-chain, and no single entity controls the network or user funds. The trust model is _opt-in_: if you prefer not to trust anyone, you can insist on fully collateralized channels (like a classic Lightning channel) and still use XLN. But if you opt in to the **fractional reserve mode**, you benefit from far greater liquidity and success rates (payments rarely fail due to a lack of route capacity, since hubs can temporarily cover shortfalls). This introduction of **explicit credit risk** is carefully managed – hubs must put up collateral and build reputation, and there are even mechanisms for on-chain insurance to cover any defaults in worst-case scenarios. In short, XLN offers capabilities that previously required either trusting a centralized service or simply weren’t possible at scale. It enables **instant, multi-currency transactions across chains** with minimal fees and high reliability, all while letting users hold their own keys and assets. There’s no equivalent on the market today in terms of this combination of speed, flexibility, and trust-minimization. By marrying the security of blockchains with the usability of traditional payment networks, XLN aims to make moving value on-chain feel as straightforward as sending an email – something that _just works_, regardless of which token you’re using or where you’re sending it.
