### Meta Layer 2

**One network to bring crypto to everyone—without juggling dozens of chains, bridges or liquidity tricks.**

---

#### The Problem

1. **Too many chains, too many rules.** New users confront different wallets, gas tokens and bridge risks on every network.
2. **Inbound liquidity walls.** Lightning nodes can’t receive unless someone funds a channel first—merchants start at zero receivability.
3. **Rollup chokepoints.** Most rollups still rely on a single sequencer that can censor or stall transactions and impose week‑long exit waits (7‑day challenge window).

**Typical rollups also face:**

- **Central sequencer risk.** Rollups rely on a central sequencer, introducing censorship and single points of failure.
- **Withdrawal delays.** Users face a 7-day withdrawal delay due to the fraud-proof challenge window.
- **Locked liquidity.** Full-reserve capital requirements result in significant liquidity being locked up.

#### XLN in a Nutshell

**Deposit contracts (“Depositaries”) on every major L1/L2 plug into a single Meta Layer.**

- Send any asset to its local Depositary.
- Instantly transact across the network using credit‑line channels—no inbound liquidity required.
- Withdraw anywhere, anytime, without sequencer delays.

#### Real‑World Impact

- **Merchant Checkout:** Accept USDC, ETH or sats with one QR code—no channel bootstrapping.
- **Cross‑Chain Payroll:** Pay teams on Solana, Ethereum and Arbitrum from one wallet, same transaction.
- **Micro‑credit:** Hubs extend $10 soft limits to new users; receivability on day one.
