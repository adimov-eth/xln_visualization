## Technical Architecture Status

### Frontend ✅
- React + D3.js visualization
- TypeScript throughout
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Context-based state management

### Backend 🚀
- Express + Socket.IO server
- Mock data generation
- Real-time event streaming
- TypeScript implementation

### Infrastructure Needs 🔄
- GraphQL API gateway (pending)
- Metrics aggregator service (pending)
- Historical snapshot store (pending)
- Production deployment setup (pending)

## Running the Application

### Development Mode:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run both server and client
npm start

# Or run separately:
npm run server     # WebSocket server on port 3001
npm run dev        # Client on port 8080
```

### Testing:
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:unit     # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete cross-chain flow animations
2. Implement time machine replay
3. Build advanced search/filter system
4. Add GraphQL data gateway
5. Performance optimization for 10K+ nodes
6. Production deployment configuration
