# Task ID: 1
# Title: Backend Foundation: Data Models & Real-time Gateway
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the backend infrastructure. Define core data models (Entity, Channel, etc.) and implement the Real-time Data Gateway using WebSocket for live updates and GraphQL for subscriptions.
# Details:
Components: Real-time Data Gateway, Metrics Aggregator Service. Data Models: `NetworkState`, `Entity`, `Channel`, `Depositary`, `ConsensusEvent`, `Transaction`. APIs: GraphQL for query/mutate, WebSocket for live diffs.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for data models. Integration tests for WebSocket connection and GraphQL schema validation. Verify that the gateway can push mock `NetworkState` diffs.
