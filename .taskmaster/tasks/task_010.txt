# Task ID: 10
# Title: Enhance Dashboard with Alerts & Finalize Accessibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement the full 'Metrics Dashboard & Alerts' feature, including health scores and user-configurable push alerts for anomalies. Perform a final accessibility polish to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and a mobile-responsive layout.
# Details:
Alerts will be driven by an aggregation microservice that streams anomaly flags. This task focuses on turning raw data into actionable signals for operators and completing the operational excellence goals.

# Test Strategy:
Trigger mock anomaly flags and verify alerts are displayed. Use accessibility audit tools (e.g., Lighthouse, Axe) to check for compliance. Test layout on various mobile screen sizes.
