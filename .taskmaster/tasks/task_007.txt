# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Layer Navigation and Advanced Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the UI for the 'Layer Navigation System' to toggle between Blockchain, Depositary, Entity, and other views. Implement a client-side search system with fuzzy search and allow users to create and save filter presets to local storage.
# Details:
This feature helps manage visual complexity. Layer toggles will filter the data rendered in the main scene graph. Search should index node properties on the client for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for filtering logic. E2E tests for toggling layers and verifying the graph updates. Test saving and loading filter views from local storage.
