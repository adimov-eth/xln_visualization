# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Core UI Interactivity & Basic Metrics Panel
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop fundamental user interactions for the graph: pan, zoom (60 FPS), and node dragging. Implement hover-to-reveal tooltips and click-to-lock behavior. Add the initial Metrics Dashboard panel to display TVL, entity, and channel counts.
# Details:
Use WebGL with a Canvas fallback for rendering performance. Metrics will be streamed from the aggregation microservice. This task completes the Phase A MVP.

# Test Strategy:
Manual UX testing for smoothness of pan/zoom/drag. Automated tests to verify that hover and click events trigger the correct state changes. Verify metrics panel updates with data from a mock stream.
