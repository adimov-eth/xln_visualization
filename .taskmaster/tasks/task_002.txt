# Title: Frontend Foundation: SPA Setup & Static Graph Rendering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the client-side React Single Page Application (SPA). Implement the 'Network Topology View' to render a static, force-directed graph of entities, depositaries, and channels using D3.js.
# Details:
Tech stack: React + D3.js. The graph should render hierarchical JSON data. Nodes should be sized by role and edges by capacity as per the PRD. This is the first visible deliverable.

# Test Strategy:
Render a static graph from a fixture JSON file. Verify that nodes and edges are displayed correctly. Component snapshot testing.
