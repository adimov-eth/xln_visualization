# Task ID: 9
# Title: Animate Cross-Chain Swaps
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Create the 'Cross-Chain Flow Animation' to visualize 8-bit hash-lock swaps. The client will listen to bridge events and animate the lock, reveal, and settlement phases across the different anchored chains in the view.
# Details:
This feature clarifies the security path and timing of cross-chain transactions, a key aspect of the XLN architecture. It depends on the client subscribing to bridge events.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate a cross-chain swap event sequence. Verify the animation correctly depicts the lock, reveal, and settlement stages on the appropriate chains.
