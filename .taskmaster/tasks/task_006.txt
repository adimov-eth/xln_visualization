# Task ID: 6
# Title: Build Consensus Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the real-time animation of consensus rounds. The client will subscribe to consensus events and visualize proposer selection and validator signatures using animated particles and progress rings.
# Details:
This feature directly addresses the 'Comprehension' problem by making abstract consensus mechanisms visible and intuitive. It requires a reliable event stream from the gateway.

# Test Strategy:
Feed a stream of mock `ConsensusEvent` data. Verify that animations trigger correctly and represent the event data accurately (e.g., proposer, validators).
