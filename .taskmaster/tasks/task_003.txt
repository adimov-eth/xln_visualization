# Task ID: 3
# Title: Integrate Real-time Data Stream
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect the frontend D3.js graph to the backend WebSocket gateway. The client must subscribe to and process live delta updates to incrementally update the network topology without full re-renders.
# Details:
The client will listen for `NetworkState` diffs pushed over the WebSocket connection and apply them to the D3 scene graph. This enables the genuine real-time UX.

# Test Strategy:
Mock WebSocket server pushes a sequence of diffs. Verify the client-side graph updates correctly and efficiently. Performance test to ensure smooth updates.
