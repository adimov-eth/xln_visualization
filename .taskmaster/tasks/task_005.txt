# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Entity Deep Dive & Channel Inspector Panels
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the contextual side panels that appear on user interaction. Implement click handlers on graph nodes and edges to fetch detailed on-demand data via GraphQL and display rich statistics, eliminating the need for CLI tools.
# Details:
These panels are a key part of the 'Operational Awareness' goal. The GraphQL queries should be designed to fetch specific entity or channel data efficiently.

# Test Strategy:
Click a node/edge and verify the correct GraphQL query is sent. Assert that the side panel is populated with the returned data. Test loading and error states.
