		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Backend Foundation: Data Models & Real-time Gateway",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Backend Foundation' task into a sequence of subtasks. Start with project setup and data model definition (e.g., using an ORM or as code types). Then, create separate subtasks for implementing the GraphQL API (schema, resolvers for queries/mutations) and the WebSocket gateway for real-time subscriptions. Include a subtask for the initial setup of the Metrics Aggregator Service stub and another for establishing the integration and testing strategy for the gateway.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to its foundational nature. It involves significant architectural decisions, combining two distinct API paradigms (GraphQL, WebSocket), defining the entire data model for the application, and setting up multiple services. Errors or poor design here will have a cascading impact on all other tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend Foundation: SPA Setup & Static Graph Rendering",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Frontend Foundation' task. Create subtasks for initializing the React application with Vite/CRA, setting up the D3.js integration within a dedicated React component, implementing the logic to render a static graph from a JSON fixture, styling the graph nodes and edges according to the PRD, and creating component snapshot tests.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. While SPA setup is standard, the integration of React and D3 for a custom visualization requires careful management of the DOM and component state. The custom styling based on data properties adds a layer of implementation detail beyond a basic D3 chart."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Real-time Data Stream",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Integrate Real-time Data Stream' task. Define subtasks for establishing and managing the WebSocket connection on the client, subscribing to the data stream, parsing the incoming delta updates, and implementing the logic to apply these deltas to the D3 graph efficiently using D3's data join pattern. Include a subtask for performance testing and another for handling connection errors and retries.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the real-time nature and critical performance requirements. Efficiently applying deltas to a complex D3 visualization without full re-renders is challenging and requires a deep understanding of both D3's update patterns and React's rendering lifecycle to prevent performance bottlenecks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core UI Interactivity & Basic Metrics Panel",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the 'Core UI Interactivity & Basic Metrics Panel' task. Create separate subtasks for implementing performant graph interactions (pan, zoom, drag), potentially using a WebGL renderer like Pixi.js with D3 for layout. Add subtasks for node-specific interactions like hover tooltips and click-to-lock state management. Finally, create subtasks for building the static UI for the metrics panel and then connecting it to a data stream.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity, primarily due to the performance requirement of 60 FPS for interactions, which likely necessitates moving beyond simple SVG rendering to a WebGL-based approach. This adds significant technical overhead. The metrics panel is simpler but adds to the overall scope."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Entity Deep Dive & Channel Inspector Panels",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Develop Entity Deep Dive & Channel Inspector Panels' task. Create subtasks for building the reusable panel UI components, defining and implementing the GraphQL queries for entity and channel details, adding click handlers to the graph elements to trigger data fetching, and managing the display of fetched data, including loading and error states.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. This is a well-understood feature pattern (list/item -> detail view). The work involves creating new UI components, managing client-side state (e.g., selected entity), and integrating with the existing GraphQL API. It's more about solid implementation than novel architectural challenges."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Consensus Visualization",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Build Consensus Visualization' task. Create subtasks for subscribing to the `ConsensusEvent` stream, designing the visual representation of consensus events (e.g., proposer selection, validator signatures), implementing the animation logic for particles and progress rings, and integrating these animations into the main view without impacting performance.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. This is not a standard chart; it requires custom animation work to represent abstract concepts visually. The challenge lies in designing and implementing these animations to be both informative and performant, running concurrently with other real-time graph updates."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Layer Navigation and Advanced Filtering",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Layer Navigation and Advanced Filtering' task. Create subtasks for building the UI for layer toggles and the search/filter panel. Implement the client-side logic for filtering the graph data by layer, and a separate subtask for implementing a performant fuzzy search using a library like Fuse.js. Finally, add a subtask for saving and loading filter presets using local storage.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. The main challenge is in the client-side data manipulation. The filtering and searching logic must be efficient to avoid UI lag, especially with a large network graph. Integrating multiple filter types (layers, search) adds to the state management complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build 'Time Machine' Historical Replay",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the 'Time Machine' feature into backend and frontend work streams. For the backend, create subtasks for designing the snapshot storage strategy (e.g., compressed deltas), implementing the snapshot capture service, and creating an API to serve historical data. For the frontend, create subtasks for building the timeline UI, fetching the historical state, and implementing a performant rehydration mechanism for the D3 graph.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to the full-stack nature of the feature. It requires significant backend work (data storage, compression, API) and challenging frontend work (UI, state management for historical data, performance optimization for full state re-renders), touching many parts of the system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Animate Cross-Chain Swaps",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Animate Cross-Chain Swaps' task. Create subtasks for subscribing to the necessary bridge events, designing the multi-stage animation (lock, reveal, settlement), and implementing each stage of the animation. Ensure the animation clearly visualizes the flow and state changes between the different chains on the graph.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. Like the consensus visualization, this involves custom animation. However, the scope is more contained as it follows a clear, sequential event flow (lock -> reveal -> settle), making the state management and animation logic more straightforward than for concurrent events."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Dashboard with Alerts & Finalize Accessibility",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into two themes. For 'Alerts', create subtasks for integrating with the backend anomaly stream, building the alert UI, and implementing user configurations. For 'Final Polish', create subtasks for conducting a full accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA), remediating all findings (color contrast, ARIA, keyboard nav), and implementing a responsive layout for mobile devices.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to combining a new feature (alerts) with a cross-cutting concern (accessibility) that touches the entire application. A11y remediation is often time-consuming and requires meticulous testing. Making a complex, interactive data visualization responsive is a significant design and engineering challenge."
