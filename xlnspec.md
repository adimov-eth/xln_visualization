## 1. Overview

This design proposes a blockchain architecture where state changes occur within isolated "machines" (actors) that communicate exclusively via events and transactions. The key components include:

- **Server:** The root machine for each user that:

  - Aggregates incoming requests/messages every 100ms into blocks with transaction maps
  - Coordinates with signers for block signatures
  - Aggregates finalized blocks from signers into Merkle trees
  - Updates state and finalizes blocks
  - Distributes messages to other servers
  - Acts as a grouping and routing mechanism
  - Maintains no consensus between servers
  - Each server is independent with its own state
  - Only tracks states of entities it participates in
  - Primary purpose is message forwarding and state organization
  - Useful for simulation (single server can simulate multiple environments)

- **Signer:** Encapsulates entities associated with a specific private key:

  - Stores private keys for transaction signing
  - Acts as parent/super-machine for Entities
  - Handles entity-level consensus
  - Can participate in DAOs as proposer, validator, or observer
  - Communicates with other signers as entity representatives
  - Derives state from server
  - Simple key-value mapping to entities
  - No separate block writing (uses server blocks)
  - Acts as intermediary router

- **Entity:** An account abstraction that can represent:

  - Personal wallets
  - Company wallets (DAOs)
  - Payment hubs/exchanges
  - Decentralized applications
  - Handles all complex business logic
  - Manages two types of transactions:
    - Channel-related transactions
    - Account-level transactions (proposals, voting)
  - State shared between participants only
  - Non-participants have no access to state
    All entity management occurs through proposals decided by signer quorums

- **Channel:** A bilateral account abstraction for message transmission:

  - Replicated in both participating entities
  - Facilitates direct entity-to-entity communication

- **Depository:** An entity with hardcoded Ethereum ABI interface:
  - Manages reserves
  - Handles channel operations
  - Resolves disputes

## 2. Account Model and State

### Server State Management

- **Block Formation:**

  - Every 100ms, each Server:
    - Aggregates incoming messages
    - Forms transaction maps
    - Coordinates with Signers
    - Creates Merkle trees from finalized blocks
    - Updates global state
    - Distributes messages to other Servers

- **State Persistence:**

  - **Memory State:**

    - All operations happen with JSON objects in memory
    - Can handle large-scale operations (e.g., 10M channels in 100GB RAM)
    - Complete state loaded at startup from LevelDB
    - Server object and signers constructed in memory

  - **Snapshot Types:**

    - **Mutable Snapshots:**

      - Stored under sequential machine IDs
      - Enables instant state restoration
      - Updated every N blocks (e.g., every 100)
      - Used for quick recovery after shutdown

    - **Immutable Snapshots:**
      - Stored by hash (Merkle DAG style)
      - Never overwritten, archived permanently
      - Enables historical state simulation
      - Allows complete system restoration to past states

  - **Data Storage Strategy:**
    - Initial MVP: Inline storage within blocks
    - Future: DAG-based transaction storage
    - Property points for granular data breakdown
    - Efficient compression in LevelDB

- **Mempool Construction:**

  - **Data Format:**
    - RLP-encoded key-value arrays
    - Keys array (`bytes32`) for routing
    - Values array for payloads
    - Single buffer composition for efficiency
  - **Routing Logic:**
    - First N values route to sub-machines
    - Remaining values execute locally
    - Real-time RLP decoding during dispatch

- **Block Storage:**
  - Blocks stored in LevelDB under block hash
  - Machine root stored under server ID
  - No explicit end-block marker
  - Previous block reference for chain continuity

### Signer State

- **Private Key Management:**

  - Securely stores private keys
  - Signs transactions for associated Entities
  - Maintains state of all controlled Entities

- **Consensus Participation:**
  - Creates blocks based on received Server data
  - Updates state according to received data
  - Participates in Entity-level consensus

### Entity State

- **Account Abstraction:**

  - Each Entity maintains its own state
  - State changes require Signer quorum approval
  - Can represent various types (wallets, DAOs, hubs)

- **Two-Tiered Management:**
  - **Proposal Phase:**
    - Transactions start as proposals
    - Require accumulation of signer votes
    - Stored as hashed voting shares
  - **Execution Phase:**
    - Executed after quorum reached
    - Batch execution at block end
    - Atomic state transitions
  - **Transaction Types:**
    - Global (server-level) execute directly
    - Entity-level require full proposal process

### Channel and Depository State

- **Channel State:**

  - Bilateral account state replicated in both entities
  - Maintains message transmission history
  - Tracks balances and commitments

- **Depository State:**
  - Manages reserve balances
  - Tracks channel states
  - Records dispute resolution status

### State Synchronization

- **Block-Level Synchronization:**
  - Server aggregates Signer blocks into Merkle trees
  - Signers maintain synchronized state copies
  - Entities update state based on approved proposals

---

## 3. Transaction and Event Flow

### Server Message Processing

- **Message Aggregation:**

  - Every 100ms cycle:
    - Collects incoming messages and requests
    - Forms transaction maps
    - Distributes to relevant Signers

- **Block Formation:**
  - Waits for Signer blocks
  - Creates Merkle trees
  - Finalizes blocks
  - Distributes to other Servers

### Signer Message Handling

- **Block Creation:**

  - Receives Server transaction maps
  - Creates blocks with state changes
  - Signs blocks and transactions
  - Returns signed blocks to Server

- **Entity Communication:**
  - Routes messages to appropriate Entities
  - Handles Entity-level consensus
  - Manages proposal voting

### Entity Message Types

- **Proposal Messages:**

  - State change requests
  - Management decisions
  - Configuration updates
  - Require Signer quorum approval

- **Channel Messages:**
  - Direct entity-to-entity communication
  - Bilateral account updates
  - Balance transfers

### Message Propagation

- **Server-to-Server:**

  - Finalized block distribution
  - Network state updates
  - Cross-server coordination

- **Signer-to-Signer:**

  - Entity representation
  - Consensus participation
  - Proposal voting

- **Entity-to-Entity:**
  - Through Channels (direct)
  - Through Depositories (mediated)

## 4. Hierarchical Submachine Architecture

### Second–Level Interactions

- **Submachine Creation:**
  - A machine can spawn submachines that operate with the same I/O structure—each having a **transaction outbox (txout)** and an **event inbox (eventinbox)**.
- **Abstract Representation:**
  - Visually, each machine can be depicted as a square with two inputs (txinbox and eventinbox) and two outputs (txoutbox and event outbox).
  - The internal state of each machine is not explicitly modeled in communications; only the final hash of operations is needed for external validation.

### Communication Flow

- **Bidirectional Messaging:**
  - Upstream (parent to child): Transactions are sent downward.
  - Downstream (child to parent): Events propagate upward.
- **Chaining of Machines:**
  - This design allows for nested layers of blockchain state changes, where high-level machines delegate tasks to lower-level submachines while maintaining synchronized state and event propagation.

---

## 5. Actor Model Alignment

### Actors as Isolated Entities

- **Conceptual Parallels:**
  - The design mirrors the actor model, where each actor (machine) is an isolated system with its own state.
  - Actors communicate solely via messages (here, transactions and events), ensuring encapsulation and modularity.
- **Real–World Analogy:**
  - Think of browser windows: each window is an independent entity that spawns new windows and communicates via events.
- **Security and Nonce Considerations:**
  - While actors are abstract and do not enforce implementation details like nonce management, the blockchain layer introduces nonces and cryptographic signatures to ensure security and sequential integrity.

## 6. Transaction Structure and Multi–Signature Validation

### Authorization and API Tokens

- **Initial Authorization:**

  - API tokens used for early-stage authorization
  - Tokens managed in memory by console
  - Checked against mempool access control rules
  - Higher-level machines have stricter controls

- **Evolution to Cryptographic Security:**
  - Initial trust-based execution for MVP
  - Planned transition to full signature verification
  - Future aggregated signature implementation
  - Integration with "egg agents" for online presence

### Transaction Format

- **Input Transactions:**
  - Each transaction includes:
    - **Sender and Receiver Addresses:** Identifying the originator and destination.
    - **Increasing Nonce:** Ensuring each transaction is unique and sequential.
    - **Data Payload:** Contains the method name and parameters.
    - **Signature:** Cryptographically ensures authenticity; supports aggregation.
- **Output Transactions:**
  - Structurally similar to inputs but differ by:
    - **Multi–Signature Requirement:**
      - For entities with multiple validators (e.g., five participants), the output transaction requires signatures from all validators.
    - **Block Voting Process:**
      - During block proposal and voting, validators append their signature to both the proposed block and each outgoing transaction.
    - **Resulting Artifacts:**
      - The proposer collects a signed block and a collection of signed transactions ready for propagation.

## 7. Event Propagation, Ordering, and Verification

### Event Sources and Aggregation

- **Event Generation:**
  - Incoming events originate from higher-level submachines that are deployed on the same node.
  - These events serve as confirmations or outputs of prior transactions executed by parent machines.
- **Synchronization Analogy:**
  - Similar to running multiple Ethereum instances in parallel, the events from each instance (or submachine) aggregate into a common "event pool" (analogous to a mempool but for events).

### Ordering and Verification

- **Definitive Event Ordering:**
  - The proposer establishes a definitive order for events based on reception timing and then disseminates this reference order across the network.
- **Validation Procedures:**
  - **For Transactions:**
    - Validators check the integrity of signatures and confirm that nonces increment correctly.
  - **For Events:**
    - Validators verify that the submachine's state is synchronized up to a specific block number and hash.
    - They confirm that the list of events matches the expected events in their local event pool—even if the order may vary slightly.

### Event–Triggered Actions

- **Upstream and Downstream Effects:**
  - Events can trigger new transactions upstream. For example:
    - An event indicating receipt of funds in a hub triggers a new transaction (`txout`) to send funds to the next designated channel.
  - Outgoing events may propagate downward toward lower-level signers, ultimately reaching the root signer machine which holds the master private key for instant block signing.

### State Management and Consensus

1. **Server Block Formation:**

   - Aggregates incoming messages every 100ms
   - Forms transaction maps
   - Coordinates with Signers
   - Finalizes blocks through Merkle tree formation

2. **Signer Operations:**

   - Receives Server blocks for signing
   - Creates own blocks for state changes
   - Participates in consensus:
     - As sole signer (automatic consensus)
     - As DAO participant (proposal-based consensus)

3. **Entity Management:**
   - All changes require Signer proposals
   - Quorum-based decision making
   - Changes propagate through Channels or Depositories
